# Latex in Python
This is a quick investigation on how to generate Latex documents (and PDFs) in Python.

To run the main.py, first do the following steps:
* Install [PyLaTeX python library](https://jeltef.github.io/PyLaTeX)
 * pip install pylatex
* Install [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/download)
* Update the latex_path variable value in the main.py to where latex.exe can be found
